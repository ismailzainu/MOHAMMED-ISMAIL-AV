								<p>The Story of my Life
I have a very fulfilling feeling about what I have been able to accomplish in my life so far. I want the absolute best for myself and those close to me. I often go above and beyond to help those around me succeed and be the best version of themselves that they can possibly be. 
My life is a mixture of moments, some happy moments and others not so much, but regardless, these moments have made me the person that I am today and I donâ€™t regret anything that had happen. I consider myself a strong, and a very determined person, I have dreams to fill the world and I am willing to do the necessary efforts to attain those dreams. My motivations I inherit from my family, more specifically my father that I love so much<p/>
